# Research Findings: React Context API

## Test 1: Basic Behavior of Context API with Different Data Types

### Setup

- Implementation of a basic context with three types of state:
  - `counter` (number): Primitive numeric value
  - `list` (array): Collection of strings
  - `record` (object): Complex data structure

### Observations

- When modifying any of the three states through their respective setters, **all** components that consume the context through the custom hook (`useBasicContext`) are re-rendered.
- This behavior occurs regardless of the data type (primitive or non-primitive) being modified.
- There is no distinction between updates of different properties: any change in the global state triggers a complete re-rendering of all consumers.

### Implications

- React's Context API does not implement any automatic optimization to prevent unnecessary renders.
- Consumer components have no knowledge of which specific part of the context has changed; they only detect that "something" in the context has been modified.
- For applications with complex state or components that render frequently, this behavior can lead to significant performance issues.
